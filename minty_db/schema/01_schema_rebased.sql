-- ===========================================================================
-- pettycash_test :: the redesign, REBASED ONTO HEAD (new prestaging database)
--
-- Derived from `01_schema 2.sql`, which is kept unmodified beside this file.
-- Do not edit both: this one is the working schema, that one is the record of
-- what was originally designed.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
--
-- `01_schema 2.sql` was written against alembic revision e5b7d9f1a3c6 - nine
-- revisions along the CURRENCY branch of the migration graph, before that branch
-- merges with the sales/cash/report work. It is not wrong; it is nine revisions
-- behind. Almost everything it appears to "drop" simply did not exist yet.
--
-- This file brings it forward to head (z1a01_drop_payer_cycle) 
-- without giving up any of its modelling.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT WAS ADDED
--
--   59 tables + 2 views     618 columns                21 enums
--   88 foreign keys         147 indexes                34 updated_at triggers
--   0 double precision      0 naive timestamp
--
-- Every one of those is MEASURED off a build of this file, not counted by hand -
-- the query is at the end of HOW TO BUILD IT. Re-measured 2026-09-15 after item
-- 18 (enum vocabulary, user.system_role restored, the tracker view carried
-- across). The previous header carried two different foreign-key counts (104
-- here, 87 further down) and two different enum counts, which is what happens
-- when they are maintained by arithmetic.
--
-- 14 TABLES - the 13 subscription/billing tables plus entity_cash_setting. Each
-- declares a model and is referenced by 3-23 files; all arrive at revision
-- a1b2c3d4e5f7, long after this design's source. Without them, subscriptions,
-- Stripe billing and terms consent are offline.
--
-- 27 COLUMNS - split three ways after checking each against the dead-column audit:
--
--   restored, live      user.reset_token / reset_token_expiry (NULL is the
--                       RESTING state of a working flow, not death), and 23
--                       others added after e5b7d9f1a3c6
--
--   restored, then       entities.period_lock_date / end_of_year_lock_date. The
--   dropped again        rebase brought them back on a count of 13 code refs
--                        each; the 2026-09-09 pass read those refs and found
--                        every one of them is a WRITE. See ERA 3 item 15.
--
--   left dropped, dead  entities.minimum_qty / deposit_frequency / deposit_day /
--                       xero_short_code and user.xero_token - model declaration
--                       only, no reader, no writer, NULL in all three databases
--
--   left dropped, dead  the 8 auth_* / django_* tables. Zero models, zero code
--                       references, five entirely empty
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- DECISION REGISTER
--
-- Three eras, oldest first. The register used to begin at the rebase, which made
-- the design look as though it started there; most of what this schema IS was
-- settled before that, and two of those earlier decisions explain findings that
-- otherwise read as mistakes.
--
--   ERA 1  the uuid7 branch          superseded, kept for its reasoning
--   ERA 2  the 01_schema 2 redesign  inherited; six principles, two reversed
--   ERA 3  the rebase                items 1-16, this file's own decisions
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ERA 1 - THE uuid7 BRANCH.  SUPERSEDED, AND RECORDED BECAUSE IT WAS.
--
-- Its schema survives as docs/schema/archive/pettycash_test_v2_schema.sql
-- (the working files were deleted on 2026-09-17). It was a different answer
-- to the same question and it was dropped, but its constraints have not gone
-- away.
--
--   A1. uuid v7 - TIME-ORDERED - as the default on every primary key, and built
--       from pgcrypto primitives rather than the native uuidv7(). PostgreSQL 18
--       has uuidv7(); SUPABASE RUNS 17.6 AND DOES NOT, and pg_uuidv7 is not
--       among the extensions Supabase offers - only pgcrypto and uuid-ossp. The
--       finished schema has to restore onto Supabase, so the function was built
--       by hand. That constraint still holds for anything that later wants v7.
--
--   A2. The function was duplicated into pettycash_test rather than shared with
--       the migration schema, so that `pg_dump --schema=pettycash_test` carries
--       its defaults instead of depending on a schema meant to be thrown away.
--
--   A3. 67 tables preserved one-for-one. No consolidation.
--
--   A4. The defect register carried as 152 COMMENT ON statements, so the schema
--       and its documentation could not drift apart.
--
--   A5. Indexes and constraints applied AFTER the load: an index maintained
--       during a bulk insert costs more than one built at the end, and the
--       foreign keys double as the migration's acceptance test.
--
--   SUPERSEDED BY "adopt the 01 schema, use the uuid from 01 schema":
--   gen_random_uuid() - v4, NOT time-ordered - and consolidated tables instead
--   of 67 preserved ones. A1's Supabase reasoning is the part worth keeping.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ERA 2 - THE 01_schema 2 REDESIGN.  INHERITED.
--
-- These are the load-bearing decisions: they are why the schema has the shape it
-- has, and two of them account for findings that look like defects until you
-- know the principle behind them. They existed only as Korean comments in
-- `01_schema 2.sql` under 주요 재설계 원칙 (DBA), based on
-- prestaging_table_08_jul_2026.sql and targeting PostgreSQL 14+.
--
--   B1. DROP THE draft/v2 TABLES.  report / report_draft / report_v2 collapse
--       into one `report` with a status state machine; report_cashcount_draft
--       into report_cash_count with the denominations normalised;
--       shop_expense_draft into report_expense; report_history_* into
--       report_history.
--
--   B2. NORMALISE THE SALES CHANNELS.  report's ~18 *_sales columns become
--       sale_info + report_sale.
--       >> This is why report.shop_sales and report.delivery_sales have no
--          column here. They are not lost: the per-method breakdown lives in
--          report_sale joined to sale_info.type, and nocashsale_total is the
--          roll-up. Readers sum rather than read a column.
--
--   B3. STANDARDISE THE TYPES.  varchar(36) -> uuid, double precision on money
--       -> numeric, timestamp -> timestamptz, status strings -> enum.
--       >> Every one of the 170 type findings in APPLICATION_CHANGES.md comes
--          from here. The numeric ones are the only bugs among them: a model
--          still declaring Float reintroduces exactly the money rounding this
--          principle was adopted to remove.
--
--   B4. SEPARATE THE TOKENS.  user (identity) -> app_user + user_token, the
--       OAuth pair 1:1. This is where User's six token columns went.
--
--   B5. FIX THE TYPOS.  "desc", sync_statuc, xero_reponse_text,
--       xero_organiztion_id.
--
--   B6. LEAVE THE DJANGO FRAMEWORK TABLES ALONE.  auth_*, django_*, sessions
--       stay with framework migrations; identity and permissions consolidate
--       into the custom role / permission / user tables.
--
--   TWO OF ERA 2's OWN DECISIONS WERE REVERSED INSIDE THE SAME FILE. Recorded so
--   they read as choices rather than inconsistencies:
--
--     * app_user -> user.  B4 named the table app_user; the file ships `user`,
--       because the source left app_user commented out while the foreign keys
--       referenced it.
--     * entity_role kept as the app's existing SIX-LEVEL hierarchy (ROLE_RANK in
--       services/permission_policy.py) rather than the redesign's
--       owner/admin/member/viewer, so user_entity.role and invitation.role
--       migrate without a lossy remap.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- ERA 3 - THE REBASE.  THIS FILE'S OWN DECISIONS.
--
-- Items 1-4 were taken while rebasing. Items 5-10 were taken 2026-09-04, after a
-- sweep that compared every enum and every foreign key against what the four
-- repos actually declare - not against what the data happens to hold today. That
-- distinction is the whole point: a survey of the data finds the values in use,
-- an enum has to cover the values the code can PRODUCE, and those are not the
-- same set.
--
-- Items 11-16 were taken 2026-09-09, at schema review. They are the first ones
-- that REMOVE things rather than widen them, and the same distinction decides
-- them from the other side: a column is dead when nothing READS it, which a
-- reference count cannot tell you and only reading the references can. Two of
-- the six columns removed here were kept by an earlier item on a count that
-- turned out to be counting writers.
--
-- 1. ENUMS ONLY FOR VOCABULARIES WE OWN. subscription_phase, extension_state,
--    transfer_status and audit_outcome come verbatim from
--    blueprints/subscription/constants.py. subscription_invoice.status and
--    subscription_email_log.status stay VARCHAR because they mirror Stripe's
--    vocabulary - an enum over someone else's value set fails closed the day
--    they add a value. Same line this file already draws for the Xero ids.
--
-- 2. SECTION K MONEY IS INTEGER CENTS, not NUMERIC like the rest of the schema.
--    Those amounts come from and go to Stripe, whose API is integer minor units;
--    converting would mean rounding at every boundary for no gain.
--
-- 3. report_expense.files / s3_key were TRANSITIONAL. DISCHARGED BY ITEM 11 -
--    the migration those columns were waiting for now exists, so they are gone
--    and the paths are attachment rows. Kept here because the condition it set
--    is the reason the columns survived three earlier passes.
--
-- 4. fk_user_current_entity was an ALTER after `entities`, not inline, because
--    user and entities referenced each other and one of the two keys has to come
--    later whichever order the tables are declared in. SUPERSEDED BY ITEM 14:
--    user.current_entity_id is dropped, so there is no cycle and no deferred
--    ALTER. `entities` still points at `user` three times; nothing points back.
--
--
-- 5. ENUMS WERE WIDENED TO WHAT THE CODE WRITES. REVERSED BY ITEM 18.
--
--    Taken 2026-09-04: nine of the thirteen enum-backed columns held production
--    values their enum rejected, because the enums had been INFERRED from a
--    sample of the data rather than read from the writers. The answer then was
--    to widen every enum to the union of both vocabularies so the load could not
--    lose a row, and to schedule the narrowing for later.
--
--    Kept in the register because the observation is still true and still
--    matters: an enum has to cover what the code can PRODUCE, and a data survey
--    cannot see that. Item 18 answers it the other way round - the vocabulary
--    is fixed here, and the code is what changes.
--
-- 6. attachment_role BECOMES TWO ENUMS.  bill_attachment and payment_attachment
--    use two different vocabularies that share only 'other'. Detail in the note
--    above the declarations.
--
-- 7. THE SERVICE BOUNDARY CARRIES NO DATABASE-LEVEL INTEGRITY.
--
--    16 foreign keys running from billing-backend's tables into Minty's (user,
--    entities, currency_info, xero_contact_sync) were dropped:
--
--      attachment.uploaded_by            bill.contact_id
--      bill.created_by                   bill.currency_id
--      bill.entity_id                    bill_attachment.created_by
--      bill_audit.user_id                entity_bill_account_xero.created_by
--      entity_bill_account_xero.entity_id
--      entity_bill_currency.created_by   entity_bill_currency.currency_id
--      entity_bill_currency.entity_id    payment.created_by
--      payment.currency_id               payment_attachment.created_by
--      xero_bill_sync.requested_by
--
--    None of them existed. Not one is a Django relation - every column above is
--    a CharField or UUIDField, and the models that do point at Minty tables
--    (shared_models/models.py) are `managed = False` read-only mirrors. Asked
--    directly, production enforces TEN foreign keys on these tables and all ten
--    stay inside billing-backend: bill, attachment, payment, xero_bill_sync.
--    Zero cross the boundary.
--
--    Six of the sixteen had unloadable data behind them - 973 rows on
--    entity_bill_account_xero.created_by alone, whose values include blanks and
--    the string '10-23-4-6'.
--
--    The cost is real and should be stated: nothing at the database level now
--    stops a bill from naming an entity that does not exist. That is the
--    existing contract between the two services, not a regression introduced
--    here, and re-adding any one of these is a one-line ALTER once the owning
--    service is ready to guarantee it.
--
-- 8. THE md5-DERIVED USER IDS STAY AS THEY ARE.
--
--    user.id is VARCHAR(36) at head and two of the 119 rows are not uuid-shaped
--    - '10-23-4-6' and '10-21-128-8', both live accounts. The loader converts
--    them with md5('user:'||id)::uuid, which is deterministic, so 02 and 03
--    agree without sharing state.
--
--    Those two values are well-formed 128-bit uuids but not RFC 9562 version-4
--    ones; the version and variant nibbles are whatever the hash produced.
--    Nothing reads them. Forcing the bits would mean changing all 24 call sites
--    in 02 plus every one in 03 in the same commit, and determinism - not
--    conformance - is the property this migration actually depends on.
--    Check B6 in 02 proves both accounts and all their references survive.
--
-- 9. entity_status AND invitation_status WERE WIDENED, NOT CONSOLIDATED.
--    SUPERSEDED BY ITEM 18, which consolidates them on the way in: active and
--    cancelled -> disconnected (measured: none of the nine ever submitted a
--    report or a bill), invitation cancelled -> revoked. The code sites that
--    write the old names are listed there.
--
-- 10. THE DATABASE IS AUTHORITATIVE; THE APPLICATION FOLLOWS IT.
--
--     Stated here because it decides the cases above and the ones still to come.
--     Where the schema and the code disagree, the schema is not automatically
--     wrong. Changing the code is a legitimate outcome, scheduled as work rather
--     than treated as a constraint that forces the column's hand.
--
--     Applied first to entity_function_map.created_by. It had been retyped to
--     VARCHAR(36) on 2026-09-04 because modules.py:534 writes an actor label
--     there. That is backwards: this design named the column a creator
--     reference, so it stays UUID with fk_efm_creator, and modules.py changes.
--     Nothing converts - the column is NULL in every source row.
--
--     It does NOT license changing a column the code is right about. Decision 5
--     went the other way on the same day: sale_type is Capitalised because
--     onboarding_state.py:166 filters on the literal, and rewriting four repos
--     to suit an enum's spelling buys nothing. The test is which side is
--     actually the better model, not which side is easier to edit.
--
-- 11. EXPENSE RECEIPTS BECOME ROWS.  report_expense loses item_code,
--     attachment_id, files and s3_key; report_expense_attachment arrives.
--
--     attachment_id could never have worked. 1049 of the 10235 populated `files`
--     values are a COMMA-SEPARATED LIST, so the model this schema declared -
--     one expense, one attachment - would have silently kept the first receipt
--     of each expense and dropped the rest. The link table is not a refinement
--     of that design; it is the design that matches the data.
--
--     item_code goes with them for a different reason - it is a Xero item code
--     on a petty-cash expense line, backfilled from the account when absent
--     (report/routes/api.py:375-394), and account_id already carries the
--     posting. It is the one column of the four with live writers, so it is the
--     one whose removal is a genuine feature decision rather than a cleanup.
--
--     report.receipt_files is dropped in the same spirit and with less doubt: it
--     had four readers, NO WRITER anywhere in blueprints/, and is NULL in all
--     three databases. It was the report-level twin of this same problem, never
--     wired up.
--
-- 12. A TOTAL DOES NOT GET A COLUMN.  report.actual_cash_total is replaced by
--     the view report_cash_summary(report_id, actual_cash_total, cash_balance),
--     and report_cash_count gains the cash_value it should always have had.
--
--     The column was written in one place from the LIVE cash_info values
--     (report/routes/cash_count.py:273-286, :361) while every reader of the same
--     quantity summed the SNAPSHOTTED value on the count row instead
--     (get_cash_count_total, cash_denominations.py:163-182). Two derivations of
--     one number, agreeing only because both ran inside the same request. The
--     view leaves one, and the snapshot wins because it is the revaluation-proof
--     one - head's model has said so since r10a10
--     (report/models/report_cash_count.py:36-38); the rebase simply never
--     carried the column across.
--
--     NULL IS PART OF THE CONTRACT. save_cash_count_details deletes the row for
--     a denomination counted as zero, so "counted, all zero" and "never counted"
--     both have no rows - and the app distinguishes them precisely by
--     actual_cash_total IS NULL (ending.py:651, :1290). A view built on an inner
--     join, or on COALESCE(...,0), would collapse the two and quietly mark every
--     uncounted report as counted. The LEFT JOIN is load-bearing.
--
-- 13. cash_addition_type, NOT withdrawal_type.  The column records whether money
--     ADDED to the float came from the company or from someone personally -
--     'personal' / 'company', validated at report/routes/api.py:1200-1201 - and
--     it now sits beside cash_addition, which is the figure it qualifies.
--     Nothing about it was ever a withdrawal.
--
--     withdrawal_bank_account goes entirely: the account actually used is the one
--     configured on entity_pettycash_settings, and a per-report override that
--     nothing reconciles against that configuration is a second source of truth
--     for the same fact.
--
-- 14. user.current_entity_id IS DROPPED, AND THIS ONE HAS A KNOWN COST.
--
--     Unlike the other removals in this pass the column is NOT dead. It is read
--     at services/user_presence.py:115 and written at :164, :176, :195, :204 and
--     :253, and auth/models/user.py:67-81 records what it is for: without it "a
--     person signed in to company A was listed as present in company B", because
--     nothing else in the row says WHICH company they are in.
--
--     It is removed on instruction, and the cost is stated rather than hidden:
--     until user_presence.py is rewritten, Settings > Users answers "who is
--     signed in to Minty" where it used to answer "who is here, in this
--     company". signed_in_at and last_seen_at are both facts about the person,
--     so neither can take over the question.
--
--     Decision 10 covers this - the schema is allowed to win and the code is
--     scheduled to follow. It is recorded at length because a later reader
--     finding a removed column with six live references should be able to tell a
--     decision from an accident.
--
-- 15. THE XERO LOCK DATES ARE NOT STORED; THE RULE IS ENFORCED INSTEAD.
--
--     entities.period_lock_date and end_of_year_lock_date are dropped. Item 33
--     of the rebase had restored them on a count of "13 code references each" -
--     but reading those references rather than counting them, every one is a
--     WRITE. backfill_lock_dates_if_needed (entity/services/settings.py:968-992)
--     fetches them from Xero and stores them; the two call sites
--     (entity/routes/settings.py:1099, settings.py:1446) exist only to trigger
--     that fetch when they are NULL. NOTHING IN MINTY EVER READS THEM. No report
--     path consults them, no template shows them.
--
--     Worse, the guard is fill-only, so a lock date moved in Xero is never
--     picked up and the stored value silently rots.
--
--     The replacement is behaviour, not storage: editing data before the
--     published lock date raises an error the user sees, checked against Xero at
--     the moment it matters. get_organisation_lock_dates
--     (xero/services/integration.py:142-198) already fetches them and needs no
--     new scope.
--
--     THE COST CROSSES A SERVICE BOUNDARY, so state it. billing-backend mirrors
--     both columns (shared_models/models.py:52-53) and DOES read them:
--     bills/services/xero_publish_service.py:369-379 forces an invoice dated on
--     or before a lock date to DRAFT. That mirror is `managed = False`, so it
--     selects every declared field and breaks the moment these columns go.
--     Removing the two fields there and moving that guard to the same live fetch
--     is part of this change, not a follow-up someone may skip.
--
-- 16. financial_year_end_day / financial_year_end_month ARE ADDED.
--
--     Neither exists anywhere in either repo today - zero hits for
--     financial_year, fiscal, year_end in Minty and in billing-backend. They are
--     new, required during onboarding, and refreshed when a Xero connection is
--     established.
--
--     The refresh is nearly free and that is the point: Xero's Organisation
--     response carries FinancialYearEndDay and FinancialYearEndMonth, we already
--     fetch that exact object at xero/services/integration.py:170 under a scope
--     we already hold, and lines 189-190 read the two lock dates out of it and
--     throw the rest away. Item 15 stops reading that object for the wrong
--     fields; this one starts reading it for the right ones.
--
--     Nullable, for the same reason country_code and currency_id are: an entity
--     mid-onboarding has not reached the step yet. CHECK constraints bound them
--     to 1-31 and 1-12 rather than a DATE, because a financial year end is a
--     recurring day-of-year, not a date.
--
-- 17. THE BILLING ACCOUNT IS THE IDENTITY, AND IT HOLDS THE CARDS.
--     Taken 2026-09-10. THIS ONE LEADS THE CODE - see the note under WHAT WAS
--     ADDED. No migration has been written yet; the schema is carrying the
--     decision first because the onboarding design that forced it is signed off.
--
--     Onboarding's card dialog (Figma 01-D) asks for an EMAIL and a BILLING
--     COMPANY before the card fields, and nothing in either repo stored either.
--     The Stripe customer carries an email, but _payer_identity() overwrites it
--     from the user record on every write, and the customer's name is the
--     payer's human name by an explicit earlier decision - an entity name there
--     "would be wrong the moment a second entity is added".
--
--     So the identity goes where the money already is. payer_billing_group was
--     already "one payment method, plus everything it pays for"; entities point
--     at it, and the cycle and the dunning clock live on it. Adding
--     billing_email / billing_company makes it the account the payer creates and
--     recognises, with no new join on any billing query.
--
--     A PAYER MAY HOLD SEVERAL ACCOUNTS, AND AN ACCOUNT SEVERAL CARDS. That is
--     what costs uq_payer_billing_group_payer_card (2.46) and what
--     billing_account_payment_method (2.47) exists for. The account still
--     charges ONE card - the id stays on the account row so renewals and dunning
--     never join to find it - and the shelf records the rest.
--
--     WHAT THIS CHANGES BENEATH: paid_through, dunning_started_at and
--     dunning_attempts were per CARD when a group was a card. They are now per
--     ACCOUNT. The grain is unchanged in practice, because one invoice is raised
--     per group either way, but the reason has moved and the docstring on the
--     model says the old one.
--
--     NOT DONE HERE, AND OWED: the identity is only true if it reaches Stripe,
--     which means _payer_identity's "our record is the source of truth" rule has
--     to yield to the account's own fields where they are set. That is an
--     application decision, and it is recorded there rather than here.
--
-- 18. THE ENUMS RETURN TO THE REDESIGN'S VOCABULARY; THE DATA IS MAPPED.
--     Taken 2026-09-15, after the review the previous section of this header
--     used to ask for ("DECISIONS REQUIRED AT REVIEW - SIX OPEN"). All six are
--     closed, and the widening of item 5 is reversed.
--
--     D1-D5 turned out to be artefacts of the two-hop pipeline: production
--     holds 'posted', 'shortage'/'surplus', 'Electronic'/'Delivery',
--     'cancelled' and all five entity states; the 'published'/'none'/'electric'
--     /'revoked'/'onboarding' variants were introduced by the schema-2 hop's
--     own mappings. The pipeline is now ONE hop (pettycashv2 at head ->
--     this schema), so there is no lossy intermediate to argue about.
--
--     That left one question, and it was answered the redesign's way: the
--     members are `01_schema 2.sql`'s, production data is mapped onto them by
--     the loaders, and the application changes to write them in a later pass.
--     The mapping lives in ONE place - generators/gen.py ENUM_MAP - and is
--     what generates 02, 03, the B3/R3 count assertions and 00. Each
--     declaration below carries the measured counts. In summary:
--
--       entity_status      active 7, cancelled 2         -> disconnected
--       system_role        superuser 1 -> superadmin, user 1 -> normal
--       invitation_status  cancelled 40                   -> revoked
--       report_status      posted 4886 -> published 4046 / submitted 790 (loaded;
--                          derived, see below)
--       publish_status     completed 3851, NULL/'' 1051, failed 11, partially_published 3
--                          -> completed 4046 / failed 14 / unpublished 801 (derived
--                          from the same fact as report_status, see below)
--       module_code        BILL 1                         -> PAYMENT_REQUEST (item 20)
--       discrepancy_type   surplus 188 -> over, shortage 272 -> short, NULL -> none
--       sale_type          Electronic -> electronic, Delivery -> delivery, Cash -> other
--       bill_status        voided 26                      -> void
--       publish_state      not_published 96               -> draft
--       sync_direction     outbound 470                   -> push
--       entity_role        'shop manager' 1               -> shop_manager
--
--     Two members that schema 2 did not have were KEPT because they are live
--     workflow states, not spellings: bill_status.returned (submitted ->
--     returned -> submitted | void, bills/api.py:431-485; 2 open bills) and
--     publish_state.failed (set on every Xero push error, drives the retry
--     action; 2 rows). Members with no writer anywhere were dropped whatever
--     the model class declares: bill_status authorised / cancelled /
--     sync_failed, payment_status cancelled / refunded, sync_status partial,
--     sync_direction inbound, report_status partially_published.
--
--     sale_type is spelled 'electronic'; schema 2's 'electric' was a
--     misspelling and item 5's Capitalised pair was the code's.
--
--     D6 is closed by uncommenting user.system_role. The global super admin
--     is mintyliveadmin@dailyminty.com (superuser -> superadmin); the second
--     non-normal row, minty.jp1@oliveandvinehk.com, holds the pre-split value
--     'user' and loads as normal.
--
--     THE CODE THAT NOW DISAGREES WITH THIS FILE, for the pass that follows:
--     the 'superuser' constant (Minty auth/system_roles.py:6,
--     services/permission_policy.py:26, admin_list.py:97, two templates;
--     billing-backend core/auth.py:61,132,226, core/views.py:34;
--     onboarding-backend core/policy.py:42 - it rides in the JWT claim, so all
--     three change together); 'posted' (ending.py:483,1568,
--     history_query.py:90) - and publish.py:2495 must ALSO set
--     status = 'published' where it sets xero_integrated today, or every report
--     published after cutover stays 'submitted' while the loaded ones say
--     'published' (report_history.html:513 can then read status instead of the
--     flag); 'shortage'/'surplus' (cash_count.py:322);
--     'Electronic'/'Delivery' (onboarding_state.py:166 and 45 more sites plus
--     five templates); invitation 'cancelled' (invite.py:421); entity
--     'active'/'cancelled'/'deleted' (create.py:1219, entity.py:33,
--     xero/routes.py:1067, list.py:486); 'partially_published' (publish.py:2514)
--     and 'processing' (submitted.py:301) -> 'publishing'; and in billing-backend
--     the TextChoices classes in bills/models.py ('voided' -> 'void',
--     'not_published' -> 'draft' including the model default at :45 and the
--     frontend union type in BillActionBar.tsx:18, plus the dead members).
--
-- 19. WHAT THE LOAD ADDS, DROPS AND COLLAPSES. Measured by scripts/schema_migration/
--     rehearse.py on the 2026-08 production dump (2026-09-15) and again on the
--     2026-09-16 dump; the numbers below are the 09-16 ones, August in brackets
--     where they moved. rehearse.py writes the full list with ids to
--     backups/<db>_not_carried.md on every run and FAILS if any of these numbers
--     moves. Nothing here is silent.
--
--     DROPPED, counted (decision: drop and count, not resurrect):
--       55 reports (43 of them posted) naming 5 entities that no longer exist,
--          with their 444 sale rows, 278 cash-count rows, 99 expenses and 5
--          history rows; 10 entity_function_map rows on the same entities.
--       43 reports that were a SECOND row for the same entity and day - the
--          abandoned report_v2 drafts r-series folded in beside the real posted
--          report (none has an expense or a cash count). The posted row wins;
--          between drafts, the one with a count, then more expenses, then later.
--          report is UNIQUE (entity_id, transaction_date) here, as designed.
--       28 (29) users whose Xero tokens sat only on the user table (May 2026, before
--          user_token existed) - every refresh token past its 60-day life.
--       sessions (Flask-Session), alembic_version, the auth_* / django_* tables.
--
--     COLLAPSED, every reference remapped to the survivor:
--       sale_info 65 -> 40 (57 -> 35): the per-entity CUSTOM_* rows that repeat a name
--          (Payme x13, JCB x9) fold onto one catalogue row per exact name, the
--          global row where there is one. entity_sale_setting and report_sale
--          point at the survivor. sale_info is UNIQUE (sale_name) here.
--
--     ADDED, because the data still named them:
--       238 (239) xero_contact_sync rows (category 'restored') and 10 (7) account_info rows
--          (description 'restored by the schema migration ...'). shop_expense
--          holds XERO ids, not internal ones; the FKs here want the internal
--          row; 947 expense lines named contacts and 368 named accounts the sync
--          tables no longer held. The contacts were deleted by the mass-delete
--          bug fixed 2026-07-23 (commit 5229231, tests/
--          test_xero_contact_sync_no_mass_delete.py); the accounts were
--          archived or renumbered in Xero. Rebuilt from contact_name /
--          account_code, which the expense row kept. No expense lost a link.
--       277 (184) report_cash_count rows of quantity 0. Item 12 replaced
--          report.actual_cash_total with a view that is NULL when a report has
--          no count rows - but the app stores no row for a zero count, so the
--          284 (190) posted reports counted as ALL ZERO would have read as never
--          counted. One inert zero row each keeps the 0. The other 7 are Test_1
--          (PHP) and BIB GROUP (no currency set), which have no denominations
--          at all; they read NULL.
--
--     MAPPED, found by the 09-16 dump: report.publishing_status
--       'partially_published' (3 posted Test_1 reports, no bank transactions) ->
--       'failed', the state the app reads it together with (history_query.py:102);
--       202 reports published before publishing_status existed (2026-01-12 ..
--       04-19: NULL there, flag set, 'published' history row) -> 'completed',
--       not 'unpublished' - and their status -> 'published' (item 18);
--       user_entity.role 'Admin' (1 row) -> admin - both role columns are
--       lower-cased and snake-cased, as the app's normalize_role does.
--
--     TRANSLATED:
--       report.uploaded_by (a username) -> created_by (the user's id).
--       one report_sale_detail id, 202608171300, is not uuid-shaped -> md5, as
--          any non-uuid key is.
--       cash_info.cash_id (serial) and report_history.id (serial) -> uuid via
--          md5, the same way the two legacy user ids are (item 8).
--       report.nocashsale_total = total_sales - cash_sales: shop_sales INCLUDES
--          cash (shop = cash + electronic; total = shop + delivery), measured on
--          3,748 of 3,847 reports. 6 draft reports have columns that disagree
--          with their own detail rows in the source; carried as they are.
--       report.created_at = date, or transaction_date where date is NULL (2).
--
-- 20. THE MODULE CODE 'BILL' IS 'PAYMENT_REQUEST'. Taken 2026-09-16.
--     entity_function.function_code names Minty's two modules. The second one
--     has always been the Payment Request module - its function_name says so -
--     and the code now says so too: PETTY_CASH and PAYMENT_REQUEST. The three
--     function_code columns (entity_function, entity_module_subscription,
--     subscription_audit_log) are the enum module_code, so after cutover the
--     writers listed below are REJECTED, not merely wrong. The loader maps the
--     value (gen.py ENUM_MAP); the tracker view filters on the new name.
--     entity_function_map is untouched - it references the row by id. "Super
--     Minty" is the billing_plan bundle row (BILL+PETTY_CASH), not a module.
--
--     NOT renamed, by decision: billing_plan.code stays 'BILL', 'PETTY_CASH',
--     'BILL+PETTY_CASH'. The plan key is derived in code as the sorted join of
--     the module codes (blueprints/subscription/models/billing_plan.py:12-14),
--     which will produce 'PAYMENT_REQUEST+PETTY_CASH' once the code follows -
--     so the plan lookup needs a mapping in the code pass. The payment-request
--     app's own tables (bill, bill_line, bill_audit ...) and enums keep their
--     names.
--
--     THE CODE THAT NOW DISAGREES, for the pass that follows: Minty
--     MODULE_BILL = "BILL" (blueprints/subscription/models/billing_plan.py:41,
--     blueprints/entity/services/modules.py:18) and ~50 references in 12 files
--     - entity/routes/create.py, modules.py, settings.py, subscription/
--     services/notify.py, portal.py, scripts/e2e_seed.py, replay_scenarios.py,
--     seed_past_due.py, seed_transfer_demo.py, preview_billing_emails.py -
--     including the JWT module claims; billing-backend core/entitlements.py (the
--     payment-request app's module gate) and bills/tests/test_deactivate_account
--     .py; onboarding-backend onboarding/services/plans.py, shared_models/
--     models.py, tests/; onboarding lib/api.ts (type ModuleCode) and
--     e2e/xeroFake.ts; billing-frontend's module claims.
--
-- 21. country_info HAS NO updated_at TRIGGER. Found 2026-09-16 in C3, decided
--     2026-09-17. The table sat in the updated_at trigger list (section 3)
--     without the column, so every UPDATE on it failed with 'record "new" has
--     no field "updated_at"' (onboarding-backend's Postgres-mode tests hit it).
--     country_info is seeded once and only read - no application code updates
--     it - so it does not get the stamps; its name comes out of the trigger
--     array instead. currency_info keeps its stamps: the source schema had them.
--
-- 22. xero_report_sync AND xero_bank_transfer CARRY created_at / updated_at.
--     Decided 2026-09-17. Both are rewritten in place when a report is
--     republished and nothing recorded when; the source schema had no stamps
--     there either. Both join the updated_at trigger list. On load the loader
--     fills them from the truthful dates rather than the cutover moment:
--     xero_report_sync.created_at <- reported_at, updated_at <- completed_at
--     (then reported_at, then now()); xero_bank_transfer <- transfer_date.
--
-- 23. subscription_invoice_line RECORDS WHAT EACH LINE PAID FOR. Decided
--     2026-09-25. period_start / period_end / unit_amount, all NULL-able. A line
--     held only its amount, kind and `at`, so the payer portal's billing breakdown
--     (08-B "Download csv", a row per company per line) had to work each line's
--     days and monthly rate back out of how that kind is priced - and could not,
--     for an access extension, once a resume had cleared the module's
--     app_access_until. Both billing engines (Minty's subscription services and
--     minty-billing-api) now write all three when an invoice is issued; the
--     breakdown reads them and derives only where they are NULL (every line issued
--     before, and the rate of an extension priced at more than one rate). No load
--     change: pettycashv2 has no such columns and 03 leaves them NULL. pettycashv3
--     only; a database already up gets the guarded ALTER in migration
--     x1a01_invoice_line_span.
--
-- 24. AN INVOICE HAS ITS OWN NUMBER. Decided 2026-10-23 (owner):
--     subscription_invoice.invoice_number = INV-<ACCOUNT>-YYYYMM-NNNN, e.g.
--     INV-ACME-202610-0042. ACCOUNT is payer_billing_group.billing_company at issue,
--     A-Z/0-9 only, at most 8 characters (no usable letter: the account's id, or the
--     payer's, cut to 6); YYYYMM the month of issued_at in UTC, like the Date column;
--     NNNN one counter per month for every account (subscription_invoice_counter, 2.52a).
--     Given once, when the row is first open / paid / uncollectible / void - never to a
--     draft - and never changed by a later rename. No backfill (owner: production has no
--     invoices yet); a row without one keeps showing Stripe's id. minty-subscription-api
--     writes it (billing/services/invoice_number.py). A database already up gets
--     migrations/i1a01_invoice_number.sql.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- HOW TO BUILD IT
--
--     psql "$URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f docs/schema/01_schema_rebased.sql
--
-- Builds clean on an empty database: 60 tables, 3 views, 627 table columns, 22 enums,
-- 88 foreign keys, 150 indexes (measured 2026-10-13 off a tests/pg_harness.py build,
-- after entity_setup_summary joined the views; the line had read 59 / 2 / 623). Every __tablename__ in Minty (44) and every db_table in
-- billing-backend (22) resolves to a table here, the nine renames included.
--
-- Then it is FILLED, in this order:
--
--   00_enum_coverage_check.sql          read-only; proves every mapped value lands
--   02_data_foundation_rebased.sql      foundation tables from pettycashv2 at HEAD
--   03_data_reports_rebased.sql         reports and billing; needs 02 committed
--
-- ONE HOP. The source is pettycashv2 at alembic head, in the same database,
-- and the loaders are generated from information_schema
-- by generators/gen.py. The redesign's own hard parts - the report/draft/v2
-- merge, the sales normalisation, the cash-count rows - are done by the
-- application's alembic chain (r1a01..r10a10, s1a01..s5a05, c1a01/c2a02) on the
-- way to head, which joins on the shared primary key rather than guessing a
-- winner by (entity, date). scripts/schema_migration/rehearse.py runs the whole
-- thing - restore, snapshot, upgrade, upgrade check, build, 00, 02, 03 - and
-- exits non-zero on any check. The schema-2 hop and its loaders are in
-- docs/schema/archive/.
--
-- The counts in this file are measured, never estimated:
--
--   SELECT (SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.tables
--            WHERE table_schema='pettycash_test' AND table_type='BASE TABLE') AS tables,
--          (SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.views
--            WHERE table_schema='pettycash_test') AS views,
--          (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_type t JOIN pg_namespace n ON n.oid=t.typnamespace
--            WHERE n.nspname='pettycash_test' AND t.typtype='e') AS enums,
--          (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_constraint c JOIN pg_namespace n ON n.oid=c.connamespace
--            WHERE n.nspname='pettycash_test' AND c.contype='f') AS fkeys;
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT THIS BREAKS IN THE APPLICATION
--
-- APPLICATION_CHANGES.md, beside this file, lists every model in Minty and
-- billing-backend that this schema no longer fits, with file and line. It is
-- generated by generators/audit_models.py -> mkdoc.py, so REGENERATE it rather
-- than editing it, and re-run it after any change here. The counts below come
-- from that regeneration and are not maintained by hand.
--
--   tables renamed out from under a model    (invitations -> invitation,
--        shop_expense -> report_expense, report_sale_detail -> report_sale, ...)
--   model columns this schema does not have  - these break every SELECT on the
--        model, not just writes, because an ORM selects all mapped columns
--   declared types that no longer match. Only the `numeric` ones are a bug
--        rather than untidiness: a model still declaring Float reintroduces the
--        money rounding this schema moved to numeric to remove.
--
-- THE 2026-09-09 PASS ADDED TO THAT LIST DELIBERATELY. Items 11-16 remove
-- columns the application still uses, which is Decision 10 working as intended -
-- the schema wins and the code is scheduled - but scheduled work that is not
-- written down is work that does not happen. The whole of it:
--
--   expense receipts   ShopExpense.files / .s3_key / .item_code, ~40 read and
--                      write sites. report/routes/api.py, expense.py,
--                      download.py, report_detail.py, services/ending.py:1462-1488,
--                      xero/services/publish.py:1061-1065, and four templates -
--                      report/expense.html, edit_report.html:470-477,
--                      report_detail.html:220-225. Reads become a join through
--                      report_expense_attachment; the three `files` formats
--                      normalize_expense_files handles become one shape.
--
--   cash total         Report.actual_cash_total readers join report_cash_summary
--                      instead. ending.py:455,651,1151,1290,1550,

--                      opening.py:1114,1149. The NULL test must survive the move.
--
--   cash addition      withdrawal_type -> cash_addition_type and
--                      withdrawal_bank_account removed. api.py:1200-1232,

--
--   presence           services/user_presence.py rewritten without

--  pettycashv2  전체 재설계 DDL  (Consolidated Redesign)
--  기준 파일: prestaging_table_08_jul_2026.sql (50+ 테이블 분석)
--
--  주요 재설계 원칙 (DBA)
--   1) draft/v2 제거: report/report_draft/report_v2 → report(status 상태머신)
--                     report_cashcount_draft → report_cash_count(권종 정규화)
--                     shop_expense_draft     → report_expense
--                     report_history_*        → report_history
--   2) 판매채널 정규화: report의 *_sales 컬럼(~18개) → sale_info + report_sale
--                     sale_info.type = electric / delivery / cash / other
--   3) 타입 표준화: varchar(36) → uuid,  double precision(금액) → numeric,
--                  timestamp → timestamptz,  상태값 → enum
--   4) 토큰 분리: user(신원) → app_user + user_token(OAuth 1:1)
--   5) 오타 교정: "desc", sync_statuc, xero_reponse_text, xero_organiztion_id ...
--   6) Django 프레임워크 테이블(auth_*, django_*, sessions)은 재설계 대상에서
--      제외(프레임워크 마이그레이션 관리) → 커스텀 role/permission/app_user 로 일원화

-- 2. ENUM 타입
-- ==========================================
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE VOCABULARY IS THE REDESIGN'S. THE DATA IS MAPPED. THE CODE FOLLOWS.
--
-- ERA 3 item 5 widened every enum below to whatever the application happened
-- to write, so the load would be lossless. That was REVERSED on 2026-09-15
-- (item 18): the members are the ones `01_schema 2.sql` designed, production
-- values are mapped onto them by the loaders (the CASE expressions live in
-- generators/gen.py ENUM_MAP and nowhere else), and the application changes
-- to write these values in a later pass. Decision 10 applied without exception.
--
-- Every mapping was measured on the production dataset before being decided;
-- the counts are recorded beside each declaration. Where a member the redesign
-- did not have turned out to be a LIVE workflow state (bill_status.returned,
-- publish_state.failed) it was kept, because dropping it would take rows out of
-- a state the user can still act on. Where a member had no writer anywhere it
-- was dropped, whatever the class in bills/models.py declares.
--
-- Four enums are not the redesign's: the two attachment-role enums (Decision 2
-- below, the split stands), expense_attachment_role (new with item 11), the
-- four subscription enums (item 1), and module_code (item 20). Those are unchanged.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- entity_status. Production: connected 49, disconnected 17, onboarding 7,
-- active 7, cancelled 2. The nine active/cancelled entities have never
-- submitted a report or a bill (measured 2026-09-15) and load as
-- 'disconnected'. 'deleted' (list.py:486) is a later code change.
CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.entity_status     AS ENUM
  ('onboarding','connected','disconnected');

-- system_role. Used by user.system_role (item 18 closed D6). Production:
-- normal 117, 'superuser' 1 -> superadmin (mintyliveadmin@dailyminty.com, the
-- global super admin), 'user' 1 -> normal (a stale pre-split value).
CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.system_role       AS ENUM ('normal','admin','superadmin');

-- entity_role: kept as the app's existing 6-level hierarchy (matches ROLE_RANK
-- in services/permission_policy.py) rather than the redesign's owner/admin/
-- member/viewer, so existing user_entity.role / invitation.role values migrate
-- without a lossy remap. Values are ordered low->high privilege.
-- One invitation holds 'shop manager' with a space; the loader maps it.
CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.entity_role       AS ENUM ('entity_base','cashier','shop_manager','accountant','admin','super_admin');

-- invitation_status. Production: accepted 264, pending 49, cancelled 40 ->
-- revoked. invite.py:421 writes 'cancelled' today and changes later.
CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.invitation_status AS ENUM
  ('pending','accepted','expired','revoked');

-- report_status. The app writes only 'draft' and 'posted': 'posted' is set once
-- at ending.py:1568 when the end-of-day wizard finishes, and
-- report_history.html:513 renders it as "Submitted". Whether the report then
-- reached Xero is a different fact, kept in xero_integrated (publish.py:2495),
-- publishing_status and report_history. So 'published' is DERIVED on load
-- (gen.py report_published(), used by BOTH this column and publish_status so
-- they cannot disagree): posted AND xero_integrated_yes AND a report_history
-- row with action = 'published' -> published; any other posted -> submitted.
-- The history row is required by decision: 3 rows carry the flag with no trail
-- (2 say 'completed', 1 says '') and load as submitted / unpublished.
-- Production (2026-09-16 dump): posted 4886, draft 73 -> loaded published 4046,
-- submitted 790, draft 25 (after the 98 reports item 19 drops). Corrected
-- 2026-09-16 twice: from posted -> published (would have marked ~840
-- never-published reports published), then from posted -> submitted (left
-- 'published' unused). ending.py:483 and history_query.py:90 say 'posted' today;
-- publish.py:2495 must write 'published' in the code pass.
CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.report_status     AS ENUM
  ('draft','submitted','published','void');

-- publish_status. The column only exists since ~2026-03-18, so 202 reports
-- published before then hold NULL beside the flag and a 'published' history
-- row; a NULL -> unpublished rule mislabelled them. Derived from the same fact
-- as report_status (gen.py report_published()): published -> completed;
-- source 'failed' and 'partially_published' -> failed; everything else (NULL,
-- '', and the 2 'completed' rows with no history row) -> unpublished. The
-- column is NOT NULL here; NULL was the resting state. Production (2026-09-16
-- dump): completed 3851, failed 11, partially_published 3, NULL/'' 1051 ->
-- loaded completed 4046, failed 14, unpublished 801. 'partially_published'
-- (publish.py:2514, 3 Test_1 reports, no bank transactions) has no member -
-- the app reads it together with 'failed' (history_query.py:102, api.py:1525);
-- whether the UI keeps the "Partially Published" distinction is a code-pass
-- question. 'processing' (submitted.py:301) holds no rows and becomes
-- 'publishing' in the code pass.
CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.publish_status    AS ENUM
  ('unpublished','publishing','completed','failed');

-- discrepancy_type. Production: none 3302, shortage 272 -> short, surplus 188
-- -> over, NULL 2 -> none. cash_count.py:322 writes the long spellings today.
CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.discrepancy_type  AS ENUM
  ('none','over','short');

-- sale_type. Spelled 'electronic', not schema 2's 'electric' (a misspelling).
-- Production: Electronic 617 -> electronic, Delivery 248 -> delivery; the
-- head-only 'Cash' seed (s7a07) -> other. onboarding_state.py:166 and 45 other
-- sites filter on the Capitalised literals today and change later.
CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.sale_type         AS ENUM
  ('electronic','delivery','other');

CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.cash_type         AS ENUM ('coin','note');

-- bill_status. Production: paid 292, submitted 157, voided 26 -> void,
-- partially_paid 4, returned 2, draft 1. 'returned' is NOT in schema 2 but is
-- a live workflow state (return_bill, bills/api.py:431-485: submitted ->
-- returned -> submitted | void), so it stays. authorised / cancelled /
-- sync_failed are declared by class Status and written by nothing.
CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.bill_status       AS ENUM
  ('draft','submitted','returned','partially_paid','paid','void');

-- publish_state: bill.published. Production: published 384, not_published 96
-- -> draft, failed 2. 'failed' is NOT in schema 2 but is written on every Xero
-- push error (xero_publish_service.py:185,292,333,477) and drives the retry
-- action in the frontend, so it stays. The model default ('not_published',
-- models.py:45) changes in the code pass.
CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.publish_state     AS ENUM
  ('draft','published','failed');

-- payment_status. Production: completed 391. 'pending' is the model default
-- and counts toward the bill cap (payment_service.py:26-40); 'partial' has no
-- writer but is schema 2's. cancelled / refunded were declared and never
-- written.
CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.payment_status    AS ENUM
  ('pending','partial','completed','failed');

-- sync_status. Production: success 446, failed 24. 'processing' has no writer
-- but is schema 2's; 'partial' was declared and never written.
CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.sync_status       AS ENUM
  ('pending','processing','success','failed');

-- sync_direction. Production: outbound 470 -> push. 'inbound' is declared and
-- never written.
CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.sync_direction    AS ENUM
  ('push','pull');

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- DECISION 2: attachment_role was ONE enum over TWO vocabularies.
--
-- billing-backend declares two separate classes both named AttachmentRole -
-- bills/models.py:214 for bill_attachment, bills/models.py:268 for
-- payment_attachment. They share only 'other'. The single enum the redesign
-- wrote held values from neither, which is why all 89 payment_attachment rows
-- (every one of them 'bank_slip') were rejected.
--
-- Splitting rather than taking the union of seven: a union would let a payment
-- carry 'approval_document', which no code path produces and no reader handles.
-- The union cannot be validated by either service; two enums can.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.bill_attachment_role AS ENUM
  ('invoice','supporting_document','receipt','approval_document','other','proof');

CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.payment_attachment_role AS ENUM
  ('bank_slip','remittance_proof','payment_receipt','other');

-- expense_attachment_role: a THIRD attachment vocabulary, and ours rather than
-- billing-backend's - report_expense_attachment is a Minty table. Decision 1
-- makes it an enum for exactly that reason.
--
-- 'receipt' is the only value the migration writes;
-- every path that produces one of these rows today is a receipt upload. The
-- other two are declared because an expense can legitimately carry a supplier
-- invoice or a stray document, and adding a value to a live enum is the one
-- change this schema wants to make least.
--
-- Deliberately NOT bill_attachment_role, which also contains 'receipt': that
-- vocabulary belongs to billing-backend (bills/models.py:214) and would couple
-- an expense attachment to a value set the other service is free to change.
CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.expense_attachment_role AS ENUM
  ('receipt','invoice','other');

-- --- subscription / billing -------------------------------------------------
-- Values taken verbatim from blueprints/subscription/constants.py, which is the
-- app's single source for this vocabulary. Not invented here.
--
-- Only the vocabularies WE define become enums. subscription_invoice.status and
-- subscription_email_log.status stay VARCHAR because they mirror Stripe's
-- vocabulary, which we do not control - the same reasoning that keeps the Xero
-- identifiers as VARCHAR rather than uuid. An enum over someone else's value set
-- fails closed the day they add a value.
CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.subscription_phase AS ENUM
  ('trial','active','past_due','scheduled_cancel','cancelled','expired');
CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.extension_state    AS ENUM

CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.transfer_status    AS ENUM

CREATE TYPE pettycash_test.audit_outcome      AS ENUM ('succeeded','aborted');

-- module_code. The module catalogue's vocabulary is closed (two modules,
-- modules.py:32 MODULE_CODES) and item 20 already renames one of them on load;
-- an enum makes the database reject a stray code the way it rejects a stray
-- status. Production: entity_function PETTY_CASH 1, BILL 1 -> PAYMENT_REQUEST;
-- entity_module_subscription and subscription_audit_log hold no rows. Typed on
-- all three function_code columns. billing_plan.code stays VARCHAR - it holds
-- composite keys (BILL+PETTY_CASH) by the item 20 decision. "Super Minty" is
-- that bundle PLAN, not a module, and needs no entity_function row.

--  K. 구독 / 청구  (Minty's own billing)
--
--  Thirteen tables that did NOT exist in the schema this redesign was written
--  against - they arrive at revision a1b2c3d4e5f7, well after it. Every one
--  declares a model and is referenced by 3-23 files, so leaving them out would
--  take subscriptions, Stripe billing and terms consent offline.
--
--  Ported into this file's idiom: uuid keys defaulting to gen_random_uuid(),
--  TIMESTAMPTZ throughout, and enums for the status vocabularies THIS APP
--  defines. The ones Stripe defines stay VARCHAR - see the note by the enum
--  declarations.
--
--  MONEY IS INTEGER CENTS here, not NUMERIC, unlike the rest of the schema.
--  That is deliberate: these amounts come from and go to Stripe, whose API is
--  integer minor units. Converting to NUMERIC(14,2) would mean rounding at
--  every boundary for no gain. The petty-cash side stays NUMERIC.

--
--   actual_cash_total   the counted cash: quantity x face value, summed over the
--                       denominations counted on that report
--   cash_balance        that plus whatever is in the safe box, which is the
--                       number the Ending page shows and calls the cash balance
--
-- WHY THIS IS A VIEW AND NOT A COLUMN. The column was written once, by one
-- request (report/routes/cash_count.py:361), from the LIVE cash_info values -
-- while every reader of the same quantity, get_cash_count_total()
-- (report/services/cash_denominations.py:163-182), summed the SNAPSHOTTED
-- report_cash_count.cash_value instead. Two independent derivations of one
-- number, agreeing only because both happened inside the same transaction. The
-- view leaves exactly one.
--
-- An all-zero count (the cash-count step done, no rows) reads NULL here too; the rule that
-- makes it 0 lives in Report.actual_cash_total. c5a05 (2026-10-13) moved it into this view;
-- that was withdrawn on 2026-10-14 (migrations/c5a05_down.sql).
--
-- NULL IS LOAD-BEARING HERE, AND IS NOT ZERO. save_cash_count_details
-- (cash_denominations.py:203-221) DELETES the row for a denomination counted as
-- zero, so a report counted as all-zero legitimately has no rows - and so does a
-- report nobody ever counted. The LEFT JOIN keeps those two apart: no rows means
-- actual_cash_total IS NULL, which is the same "was this counted at all" signal
-- that report.actual_cash_total IS NOT NULL used to carry at ending.py:651 and
-- :1290 and at cash_denominations.py:279-288. A SUM in an unconditional join

-- cash_balance is NULL on those same rows, deliberately. The fallback for a
-- report with no count - showing closing_balance instead - is a decision about
-- what to DISPLAY (ending.py:653-659), so it stays in the application rather
-- than being baked in here where the "never counted" case would become
-- indistinguishable from a counted zero all over again.
--
-- safe_box_balance is COALESCEd because it is genuinely optional: a report can
-- have a cash count and no safe box, and that is a balance of the cash counted,
-- not an unknown.

-- entity_setup_summary: one row per company describing how far its setup has got.
-- It existed only in Supabase (created by hand) until 2026-10-13; the code reads it now:
-- the petty-cash setup check and its "what's missing" list (xero/services/settings.py),
-- the module flags of GET /api/me/entities (entity/services/entity_list.py), onboarding
-- resume (both engines) and onboarding finalize's setup rule (minty-onboarding-api).
-- This is the Supabase original. c5a05 (2026-10-13) added pettycash_account_id and
-- bill_accounts_default_inactive; that was withdrawn on 2026-10-14 (migrations/c5a05_down.sql),
-- and the code reads those two facts from entity_pettycash_settings and
-- entity_bill_account_xero instead.
